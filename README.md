# Abstract

In this project, 691 instances of glioma cases are examined for more than 5000 different genes to find out important genes which would be responsible for glioma cases by carrying out t-test for normal and tumor cells. We also examined which genes would be responsible for Glioblastoma (grade IV glioma) via carrying out t-test for grade IV and grade II and III patients. Data is derived from TCGA project. Finally we tried to find out whether there exist a linear relationship between age and expression level of genes that would be responsible for cancer cases via carrying out a regression analysis for every single gene and age.
