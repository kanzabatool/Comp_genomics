Replace the patient's gene names with thier corresponding HGSV symbol using EnsembletoGeneID.txt file provided

Make a separate table. Replace the file names of the data with it's corresponding TCGA ID values from "FileNameTCGAidtable" provided

Categorize this data as 'Normal' or 'Tumor' using 'cases_0_samples_0_sample_type' column from FileNameTCGAidtable file

Now, use "mmcs" file and add the corresponding details into the data [preferably only GLioma subtypesm lgm123 and lgm456]
